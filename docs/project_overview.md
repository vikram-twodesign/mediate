# Medical Consultation Assistant - Project Overview

## Project Vision
A web application that enhances doctor-patient consultations by recording conversations, generating structured reports, providing real-time question suggestions, and offering preliminary diagnostic assistance based on conversation analysis and document uploads.

## Requirements and Planning
Before development begins, a comprehensive requirements gathering and planning phase is essential to:
- Define clear user stories and acceptance criteria for each feature
- Create wireframes and interactive prototypes for early user validation
- Establish a detailed data model for patient information and medical data
- Identify third-party APIs and services that will be integrated
- Address regulatory and compliance requirements upfront

## Core Features

1. **Conversation Recording & Transcription**
   - Real-time audio recording of doctor-patient consultations
   - Accurate speech-to-text transcription with medical terminology support
   - Secure data handling compliant with healthcare regulations

2. **Real-Time Analysis & Suggestion Engine**
   - Analysis of patient symptoms as they're mentioned
   - Contextually relevant question suggestions for doctors
   - Medical knowledge base integration

3. **Automated Report Generation**
   - Structured consultation summaries
   - Preliminary diagnostic suggestions with confidence ratings
   - Colour-coded severity indicators for urgent conditions

4. **Document Capture & Analysis**
   - Camera integration for capturing patient documents and reports
   - OCR and analysis of document content
   - Integration of document data into the diagnostic process

5. **User Interface**
   - Simple, intuitive controls for busy clinical environments
   - Clear visualisation of transcription, suggestions, and analysis
   - Minimal interaction required during consultation

## Recommended Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/UI (built with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux Toolkit
- **Media Capture**: Browser MediaRecorder API for audio, HTML5 for image uploads

### Backend
- **Framework**: Python with FastAPI (high performance, async support)
- **API Design**: RESTful with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 with JWT
- **Key Libraries**:
  - **NLP**: spaCy, NLTK, or Hugging Face Transformers
  - **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
  - **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (if needed)
  - **API Clients**: httpx for async HTTP requests to third-party services

### Database (Two Options)

#### Option 1: MongoDB
- **Use case**: When flexibility and schema evolution are priorities
- **Advantages**: Flexible schema for evolving data structures, JSON-like document model

#### Option 2: PostgreSQL (Recommended for Medical Data)
- **Use case**: When data integrity and structured relationships are critical
- **Advantages**: ACID compliance, better for complex queries, stronger data validation

### Asynchronous Processing
- **Task Queue**: Celery or FastAPI background tasks
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ or Redis
- **Use case**: Handling long-running tasks like audio processing, report generation

### AI/ML Services
- **Speech Recognition**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or AWS Transcribe for advanced medical terminology
- **Natural Language Processing**: OpenAI GPT-4 API for analysis and suggestions
- **Image Processing**: Google Cloud Vision API or Azure Computer Vision for OCR
- **Medical Knowledge Integration**: APIs like Infermedica or custom knowledge base

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Containerisation**: Docker
- **Deployment**: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS) or Azure (with healthcare compliance)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking, Prometheus for metrics

## Technical Considerations

### Healthcare Compliance
- HIPAA/GDPR compliance for patient data
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Proper consent management and audit trails
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

### Performance Considerations
- Real-time transcription with minimal latency
- Efficient API usage for third-party AI services
- Asynchronous processing for intensive tasks
- Optimised for reliable operation in various network conditions

### Scalability
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling of components
- Efficient data storage and retrieval for large audio files and transcripts
- Caching strategy for repeated queries and knowledge base access

## Development Approach
- Agile methodology with 2-week sprints
- Initial MVP focusing on core transcription and basic analysis
- Early user testing with medical professionals
- Phased implementation of advanced features
- Comprehensive documentation at each phase
- Python-specific best practices:
  - Type hints throughout the codebase
  - Clear separation of concerns (FastAPI routers, services, repositories)
  - Unit tests with pytest
  - Comprehensive docstrings and API documentation
