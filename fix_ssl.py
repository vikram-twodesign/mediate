Fix SSL Certificate Verification Issues

This script directly patches the Python SSL module to bypass certificate verification
for development purposes ONLY. DO NOT use this in production!

Usage:
1. Run this script directly: python fix_ssl.py
2. Or import it in your application: import fix_ssl

After running this script, restart your application for the changes to take effect.
